	How many hours until Next becomes OurWorldInData.org? Here's what the team is predicting	estimatedHoursUntilShip	When a project will ship is never a certaintyâ€”lots of variables can impact the final ship date. One forecasting approaching is to build an ensemble of different models and average the results. In this chart, each model was trained differently before generating their predictions. Some implement a "calm" algorithm. Others, a "caffeinated" one. The ensemble should provide a better forecast than any individual prediction.
