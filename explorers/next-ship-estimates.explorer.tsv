	How many hours until Next becomes OurWorldInData.org? Here's what the team is predicting	estimatedHoursUntilShip	When a project will ship is never a certaintyâ€”lots of variables can impact the final ship date. One forecasting approaching is to build an ensemble of different models and average the results. In this chart, each model was trained differently before generating their predictions. Some implement a "calm" algorithm. Others, a "caffeinated" one. The ensemble should provide a better forecast than any individual prediction.

	How many hours until Next becomes OurWorldInData.org? Here's what the team is predicting, by country	estimatedHoursUntilShip	Countries that have implemented strict lockdown measures have higher rates of indoor time and thus more optimistic about the amount of work we can get done in a shorter time period.	By country	true	WorldMap	false	This chart doesn't actually work yet, but wouldn't it be nice if we could do group by on the fly!
