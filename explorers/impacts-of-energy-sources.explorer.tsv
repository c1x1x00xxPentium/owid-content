	Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity	Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions measure amount of total greenhouse gases emitted over a technology's full supply chain. This includes emissions from the burning of fuels, in addition to those generated through the mining of materials, and production of energy technologies.

Dissipated water includes all uses that immediately deprive the local environment of using water. This therefore gives some indication of local scarcity of a water resource. For example, water immediately returned to the environment (in river, ocean, or groundwater) is not counted, while water used as an ingredient for a chemical product, or evaporated, is counted.
