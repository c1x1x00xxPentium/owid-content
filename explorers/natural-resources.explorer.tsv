As a convenience to the public, EIA provides these crude oil reserve estimates from other sources, but it does not certify these data. Please carefully note the sources of the data when using and citing estimates of crude oil reserves.</p><p>Data for Kuwait and for Saudi Arabia each include one-half of the reserves in the Neutral Zone. Similar allocations may exist for areas with joint production agreements."</p>	2	0	1,,;10,,;50,,;100,,;500,,;1000,,;5000	true	OrRd	false
