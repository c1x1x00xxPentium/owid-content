Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, Blavatnik School of Government.			<p>OxCGRT collects publicly available information on indicators of government response. These indicators take policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc. and record them on an ordinal scale; the remainder are financial indicators such as fiscal or monetary measures.<p>OxCGRT measures the variation in governments’ responses using its 'COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index (Stringency Index)'. This composite measure is a simple additive score of nine indicators measured on an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. Please note that this measure is for comparative purposes only, and should not necessarily be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response.<p>It also includes a measure of 'COVID-19 Containment and Health Response' index which is based on the metrics used in the 'Stringency Index' plus testing policy and contact tracing.<p>Note: This is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data please contact us on the feedback form below. The underlying index is evolving as the situation and data evolves from country to country, and will change over time as the data gets more accurate.

	p_scores_all_ages	Excess mortality during COVID-19: The number of deaths from all causes compared to previous years, all ages	DecimalPercentage	%	Human Mortality Database, Excess Mortality Data (2020)	https://www.mortality.org/	The Human Mortality Database; UK Office for National Statistics			<p>Data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project for all countries except the UK (HMD has data for England & Wales, Scotland, and N. Ireland but not the UK as a whole). UK data sourced from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).<p>We used the raw weekly death data from HMD to calculate P-scores. The P-score is the percentage difference between the number of weekly deaths in 2020 and the average number of deaths in the same week over the years 2015–2019. For the UK P-scores were calculated by the ONS.<p>We do not show the most recent weeks of countries’ data series. The decision about how many weeks to exclude is made individually for each country based on when the reported number of deaths in a given week changes by less than ~3% relative to the number previously reported for that week, implying that the reports have reached a high level of completeness. The exclusion of data based on this threshold varies from zero weeks (for countries that quickly reach a high level of reporting completeness) to four weeks.
