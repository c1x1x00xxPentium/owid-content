	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Business-as-usual	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario.

	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Combined interventions	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 if all approaches are combined: (1) closing yield gaps; (2) halving food waste; (3) global adoption of healthy diets in line with nutritional requirements; and (4) the optimisation of agricultural production to avoid the most at-risk locations for habitat loss.
