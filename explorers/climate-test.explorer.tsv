	Global warming: monthly temperature anomaly	The combined land-surface air and sea-surface water temperature anomaly is given as the deviation from the 1951–1980 mean.	Temperature anomaly	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
	Global warming: monthly sea surface temperature anomaly	This is measured at a nominal depth of 20cm, and given relative to the average temperature from the period of 1961 - 1990.	Sea surface temperature anomaly	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
	Global warming: heat content in the top 700 meters of the world's oceans	Ocean heat content is measured relative to the 1971–2000 average, which is set at zero for reference. It is measured in 10²² joules. For reference, 10²² joules are equal to approximately 17 times the amount of energy used globally every year.	Ocean heat content (top 700m)	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false	Heat content is shown for four sources: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI).
	Global warming: heat content in the top 2,000 meters of the world's oceans	Ocean heat content is measured relative to the 1971–2000 average, which is set at zero for reference.

	Ocean acidification: mean seawater pH	Mean seawater pH is shown based on in-situ measurements of pH from the Aloha station in Hawaii.	Ocean pH	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
	Sea level rise	Global mean sea level rise is measured relative to the 1993 - 2008 average sea level. This is shown as three series: the widely-cited Church & White dataset; the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHLSC); and the average of the two.

	Climate change: Antarctic minimum sea ice extent	The minimum and maximum sea ice extent typically occur in February and September each year.	Antarctic sea ice extent	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
	Climate change: change in mass of ice sheets	Cumulative change in mass of ice sheets, measured relative to a base year of 2002. For reference, 1 trillion metric tons is equal to about 260 cubic miles of ice—enough to raise sea level by about 3 millimeters.	Mass balance of ice sheets	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
	Climate change: change of mass of US glaciers	Cumulative mass balance of U.S. reference glaciers, relative to the base year 1965. This is given in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier.	Mass balance of U.S. Glaciers	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
	Snow cover in North America	This metric measures the average area covered by snow, averaged over an entire year based on an analysis of weekly maps. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland).	Snow cover	false			false		owid-distinct	LineChart	false
